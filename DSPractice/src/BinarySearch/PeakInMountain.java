/*
 * we are traversing the start,end from opposite directions
 * And compare the middle > middle + 1 if true then we are increasing order just increment the start to mid + 1
 * And simultaneouly comparwe the middle < middle -1 if true we are in decreasing order just consider the middle as possible peak continue comparing it with left side elements
 * When both end progress towards left and start progress towards right
 * at one point the loop breaks i.e start < end at that time start and end will point to the same index that will be the peek element
